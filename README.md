# Frozn: Gaming Platform Database
This project is about creating a strong Gaming Platform Database, acting as the central
hub for managing games, users, reviews, and player progress. It's designed to be user-friendly for
game publishers, gamers, and administrators. For game publishers, it provides easy tools for
gaining valuable insights into player preferences and market trends. Gamers get a personalized
experience with game exploration and progress tracking. Administrators have tools for
maintaining a positive gaming environment. Within our Gaming Platform Database, we
introduce a feature that adds a layer of dynamism to the gaming experience. For instance, the
ability to compare game features. This functionality empowers users to explore and filter games
based on average ratings, providing a more tailored and engaging journey through the gaming
catalog. The goal is to make gaming more enjoyable for everyone involved
# Features
